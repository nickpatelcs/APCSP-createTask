# APCSP-createTask
CSV Reader created for my AP CSP Create Task.

The program takes input from the user by asking them the month in which they want daily temperatures from. It takes the data and puts it into a list, where the average and maximum temperature is found using a function. It then returns this to the user. It asks for a second month to compare the first set of data to, and allows the user to select a certain number of days it wants data from. Uses weather data from 2001-2010 in two seperate CSV files (which were cleaned manually).
